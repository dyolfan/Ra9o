1502  This essay was improved by conversations with a large number of people who helped debug it.
1503  Particular thanks to Jeff Dutky <dutky@wam.umd.edu>, who suggested the "debugging is parallelizable"
1504  formulation, and helped develop the analysis that proceeds from it. Also to Nancy Lebovitz
1505  <nancyl@universe.digex.net> for her suggestion that I emulate Weinberg by quoting Kropotkin.
1506  Perceptive criticisms also came from Joan Eslinger <wombat@kilimanjaro.engr.sgi.com> and Marty Franz
1507  <marty@net-link.net> of the General Technics list. Glen Vandenburg <glv@vanderburg.org> pointeed out
1508  the importance of self-selection in contributor populations and suggested the fruitful idea that
1509  much development rectifies 'bugs of omission'; Daniel Upper <upper@peak.org> suggested the natural
1510  analogies for this. I'm grateful to the members of PLUG, the Philadelphia Linux User's group, for
1511  providing the first test audience for the first public version of this essay.  Paula Matuszek
1512  <matusp00@mh.us.sbphrd.com> enlightened me about the practice of software management. Phil Hudson
1513  <phil.hudson@iname.com> reminded me that the social organization of the hacker culture mirrors the
1514  organization of its software, and vice-versa. John Buck <johnbuck@sea.ece.umassd.edu> pointed out
1515  that MATLAB makes an instructive parallel to Emacs. Russell Johnston <russjj@mail.com> brought me to
1516  consciousness about some of the mechanisms discussed in "How Many Eyeballs Tame Complexity."
1517  Finally, Linus Torvalds's comments were helpful and his early endorsement very encouraging.

1462  I quoted several bits from Frederick P. Brooks's classic The Mythical Man-Month because, in many
1463  respects, his insights have yet to be improved upon. I heartily recommend the 25th Anniversary
1464  edition from Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0-201-83595-9), which adds his 1986 "No Silver Bullet" paper.
1465
1466  The new edition is wrapped up by an invaluable 20-years-later retrospective in which Brooks
1467  forthrightly admits to the few judgements in the original text which have not stood the test of
1468  time. I first read the retrospective after the first public version of this essay was substantially
1469  complete, and was surprised to discover that Brooks attributed bazaar-like practices to Microsoft!
1470  (In fact, however, this attribution turned out to be mistaken. In 1998 we learned from the Halloween
1471  Documents that Microsoft's internal developer community is heavily balkanized, with the kind of
1472  general source access needed to support a bazaar not even truly possible.)
1473
1474  Gerald M. Weinberg's The Psychology Of Computer Programming (New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold 1971)
1475  introduced the rather unfortunately-labeled concept of "egoless programming". While he was nowhere
1476  near the first person to realize the futility of the "principle of command", he was probably the
1477  first to recognize and argue the point in particular connection with software development.
1478
1479  Richard P. Gabriel, contemplating the Unix culture of the pre-Linux era, reluctantly argued for the
1480  superiority of a primitive bazaar-like model in his 1989 paper "LISP: Good News, Bad News, and How
1481  To Win Big". Though dated in some respects, this essay is still rightly celebrated among LISP fans
1482  (including me). A correspondent reminded me that the section titled "Worse Is Better" reads almost
1483  as an anticipation of Linux. The paper is accessible on the World Wide Web at
1484  http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html.
1485
1486  De Marco and Lister's Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams (New York; Dorset House, 1987; ISBN
1487  0-932633-05-6) is an underappreciated gem which I was delighted to see Fred Brooks cite in his
1488  retrospective. While little of what the authors have to say is directly applicable to the Linux or
1489  open-source communities, the authors' insight into the conditions necessary for creative work is
1490  acute and worthwhile for anyone attempting to import some of the bazaar model's virtues into a
1491  commercial context.
1492
1493  Finally, I must admit that I very nearly called this essay "The Cathedral and the Agora", the latter
1494  term being the Greek for an open market or public meeting place. The seminal "agoric systems" papers
1495  by Mark Miller and Eric Drexler, by describing the emergent properties of market-like computational
1496  ecologies, helped prepare me to think clearly about analogous phenomena in the open-source culture
1497  when Linux rubbed my nose in them five years later. These papers are available on the Web at
1498  http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html.
